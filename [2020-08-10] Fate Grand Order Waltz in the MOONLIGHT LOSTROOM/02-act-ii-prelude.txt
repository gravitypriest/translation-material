    Act II: Prelude
=============================================================
Thank you for waiting. The ball will resume.
Please, continue your beautiful dance with Mash.

Though...
I know of Tamamo-no-Mae, but Tamamo Cat on the other hand...

Well, this too is some kind of fate.
Shall I arrange a kimono that makes the best of the power of the wild?
------------------------------------------------------------
The elegant dance of a ball is well and good, but perhaps the real pleasure of dance is passionate steps as well.

The queen of the Land of Shadows...
Without a doubt, someone knowledgeable in civilization, wise, and lively...
Seems like I got into a rhythm too...

The costume makes use of her distinctive characteristics, like this.
An adult’s femininity, wouldn’t you say?
------------------------------------------------------------
I hear you met all sorts of female Servants in the Fifth Singularity.
Even among them, this one seems to be particularly charming.
A scholar, rather than a mage...
In that case, it’s got to be a school uniform motif.

Please leave it to me. My creative juices are flowing!
When I get like this I can’t help but want to weave and weave!
------------------------------------------------------------
Even oni must be elegant.
Even while drunk on blood, to think they prefer the elegance of the capital...
Since this too is one whimsy, so must the song and costume be bold as well.
Do you like Japanese metal?

If you were able to meet a Servant like this, your journey must have been truly fun.

It goes without saying, but please allow me to prepare the costume.

Since we’ve come all this way, how about a leather jacket and fishnet tights...
------------------------------------------------------------
About a certain goddess that you met in the Seventh Singularity.
I understand that she was a Pseudo-Servant possessing a human.

A freewheeling troublemaker...
Good and bad luck are two sides of the same coin.

Certainly, it seems it was a journey full of trouble and laughter.

The outfit is... like this on purpose.
Let’s say this is how that goddess appeared to me.
------------------------------------------------------------
Well done.
We'll draw the curtain briefly.

Because, MOONLIGHT is a Singularity of warped spacetime.
It probably wasn’t good to put it right behind Chaldeas.
One second can become one minute, and one minute can become ten minutes.

Please allow for short while until the reopening.
