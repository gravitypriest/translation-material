    Act III: Interlude
=============================================================
MOONLIGHT is a special room for only one night.
What happens here is in the present for you, and an illusion for the others.

Just like this swordsman.
Not all of the many incidents that happen at Chaldea are “absolute.”
There are probably some events that people will never witness.

But, those memories are by no means illusions.
Perhaps this dress will be the best proof of that.
------------------------------------------------------------
There are some you met as enemies that became allies...

The way of their hearts don’t change, but when you find a common goal, they may entrust their back to you.

Your journey seems to have been blessed with just such strange coincidences.

I’ve taken the liberty of preparing a different version of a dress that I made previously..
------------------------------------------------------------
“Love is war!
If force doesn’t work, pin them down!”

———I’m sorry.
For some reason, a very brave feeling came over me.
Hehe. If I were like her, I might have never flown away from my husband.

I wanted to represent that feeling with this dress.
The queen look is cool.
------------------------------------------------------------
There are some things that you can’t touch, no matter how much you love them...
Fate is cruel.
You can never get the things you really want.

However, you can pray for good luck for that “something.”

MOONLIGHT is a moonlit ball held for that reason.
Borrowing her feelings, I completed an appropriate dress.
------------------------------------------------------------
Your experience until now, and your accumulated joy, are very wonderful things.

Just as your journey during the Restoration of Human Order was long,

Just as the dream of the girl running through the meadow is distant,

Just as the moonlight not here, beyond time.

Just as this next costume is a special and elaborate one.
------------------------------------------------------------
You have completed all the music.
Thank you very much, young Master of Chaldea.
Whatever kind of journeys that you and Mash have gone through———

I’m sure they are being transmitted even to that person who created MOONLIGHT.

Ah, but there’s one last thing.
Please show me one more song.
